### Form-From-Json Generator

This app built using ReactJS, Typescript, [Formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik) and [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) demonstrates generation of forms from json. To handle errors which may cause both app crashing and form failure, served json is validated using predefined Yup schema. Errors in json structure, if any, are displayed, so that you know what is wrong. Form validation rules, if they are present in json, are also generated dynamically using Yup.
